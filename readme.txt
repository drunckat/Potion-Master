This application helps you to create the most complex potion you can. 
(but you will not know their effect before you create them :-), may be some day i'll make feature for it).

User needs to fill third column in txt file (i recommend to fill data.txt and put it in the folder with application. If you don't want
to use data.txt, you may compose your own. Data.txt is a template in this case. You can skip the fields of ingredients that are not present
in your bag, but it it obligatory to write the ingredient ID, its name(name can be changed, but be in one word) and its quantity.)

Priority of application is to compose potion or poison with the greatest quantity of benefits or defects (but it does not mix them).
Secondary priority is to make them as much as it possible.
